# data604-FashionMNIST
In this project, I use the Fashion MNIST dataset. The Fashion MNIST dataset consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 test images across 10 different clothing categories. Each image is a grayscale image of fashion items of size 28x28 pixels, which is flattened into a 784-dimensional feature vector. The dataset was taken from Zalando Researchâ€™s GitHub repository.
